The pipeline consisted of quality control, alignment to the reference genome, post-alignment, and SNP calling. Three approaches to parallelization were compared: (i) a plain Bash script in which a pipeline for each cow was executed as separate processes invoked at the same time, (ii) a Bash script wrapped in a single Nextflow process and (iii) a Nextflow script with each component of the pipeline defined as a separate process. The results demonstrated that on average, the multi-process Nextflow script performed 15–27\\% faster depending on the number of assigned threads, with the biggest execution time advantage over the plain Bash approach observed with 10 threads. In terms of RAM usage, the most substantial variation was observed for the multi-process Nextflow, for which it increased with the number of assigned threads, while RAM consumption of the other setups did not depend much on the number of threads assigned for computations. Due to intermediate and log files generated, disk usage was markedly higher for the multi-process Nextflow than for the plain Bash and for the single-process Nextflow.}",

Force-directed graph-drawing algorithms are widely used to draw such graphs. However, these methods do not guarantee a sub-quadratic running time in general. We present a new force-directed method that is based on a combination of an efficient multilevel scheme and a strategy for approximating the repulsive forces in the system by rapidly evaluating potential fields. Given a graph G=(V,E), the asymptotic worst-case running time of this method is O({\ensuremath{|}}V{\ensuremath{|}}log{\ensuremath{|}}V{\ensuremath{|}}+{\ensuremath{|}}E{\ensuremath{|}}) with linear memory requirements. In practice, the algorithm generates nice drawings of graphs with 100000 nodes in less than 5 minutes. Furthermore, it clearly visualizes even the structures of those graphs that turned out to be challenging for other methods.}

	abstract={The short arms of the human acrocentric chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22 (SAACs) share large homologous regions, including ribosomal DNA repeats and extended segmental duplications1,2. Although the resolution of these regions in the first complete assembly of a human genome---the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium's CHM13 assembly (T2T-CHM13)---provided a model of their homology3, it remained unclear whether these patterns were ancestral or maintained by ongoing recombination exchange. Here we show that acrocentric chromosomes contain pseudo-homologous regions (PHRs) indicative of recombination between non-homologous sequences. Utilizing an all-to-all comparison of the human pangenome from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium4 (HPRC), we find that contigs from all of the SAACs form a community. A variation graph5 constructed from centromere-spanning acrocentric contigs indicates the presence of regions in which most contigs appear nearly identical between heterologous acrocentric chromosomes in T2T-CHM13. Except on chromosome 15, we observe faster decay of linkage disequilibrium in the pseudo-homologous regions than in the corresponding short and long arms, indicating higher rates of recombination6,7. The pseudo-homologous regions include sequences that have previously been shown to lie at the breakpoint of Robertsonian translocations8, and their arrangement is compatible with crossover in inverted duplications on chromosomes 13, 14 and 21. The ubiquity of signals of recombination between heterologous acrocentric chromosomes seen in the HPRC draft pangenome suggests that these shared sequences form the basis for recurrent Robertsonian translocations, providing sequence and population-based confirmation of hypotheses first developed from cytogenetic studies 50 years ago9.},

These models offer the opportunity to study the entire genomic diversity of a population, including structurally complex regions. Nevertheless, analyzing hundreds of gigabase-scale genomes using pangenome graphs is difficult as it is not well-supported by existing tools. Hence, fast and versatile software is required to ask advanced questions to such data in an efficient way.We wrote Optimized Dynamic Genome/Graph Implementation (ODGI), a novel suite of tools that implements scalable algorithms and has an efficient in-memory representation of DNA pangenome graphs in the form of variation graphs. ODGI supports pre-built graphs in the Graphical Fragment Assembly format. ODGI includes tools for detecting complex regions, extracting pangenomic loci, removing artifacts, exploratory analysis, manipulation, validation and visualization. Its fast parallel execution facilitates routine pangenomic tasks, as well as pipelines that can quickly answer complex biological questions of gigabase-scale pangenome graphs.ODGI is published as free software under the MIT open source license.

	abstract={Here the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium presents a first draft of the human pangenome reference. The pangenome contains 47 phased, diploid assemblies from a cohort of genetically diverse individuals1. These assemblies cover more than 99{\%} of the expected sequence in each genome and are more than 99{\%} accurate at the structural and base pair levels. Based on alignments of the assemblies, we generate a draft pangenome that captures known variants and haplotypes and reveals new alleles at structurally complex loci. We also add 119{\thinspace}million base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and 1,115 gene duplications relative to the existing reference GRCh38. Roughly 90{\thinspace}million of the additional base pairs are derived from structural variation. Using our draft pangenome to analyse short-read data reduced small variant discovery errors by 34{\%} and increased the number of structural variants detected per haplotype by 104{\%} compared with GRCh38-based workflows, which enabled the typing of the vast majority of structural variant alleles per sample.},

	ABSTRACT={The Reference Human Genome remains the single most important resource for mapping genetic variations and assessing their impact. However, it is monophasic, incomplete and not representative of the variation that exists in the population. Given the extent of ethno-geographic diversity and the consequent diversity in clinical manifestations of these variations, population specific references were developed overtime. The dramatically plummeting cost of sequencing whole genomes and the advent of third generation long range sequencers allowing accurate, error free, telomere-to-telomere assemblies of human genomes present us with a unique and unprecedented opportunity to develop a more composite standard reference consisting of a collection of multiple genomes that capture the maximal variation existing in the population, with the deepest annotation possible, enabling a realistic, reliable and actionable estimation of clinical significance of specific variations. The Human Pangenome Project thus is a logical next step promising a more accurate and global representation of genomic variations. The pangenome effort must be reciprocally complemented with precise variant discovery tools and exhaustive annotation to ensure unambiguous clinical assessment of the variant in ethno-geographical context. Here we discuss a broad roadmap, the challenges and way forward in developing a universal pangenome reference including data visualization techniques and integration of prior knowledge base in the new graph based architecture and tools to submit, compare, query, annotate and retrieve relevant information from the pangenomes. The biggest challenge, however, will be the ethical, legal and social implications and the training of human resource to the new reference paradigm.}

  abstract = {Advantages of pangenomes over linear reference assemblies for genome research have recently been established. However, potential effects of sequence platform and assembly approach, or of combining assemblies created by different approaches, on pangenome construction have not been investigated. Ten haplotype-resolved assemblies of three bovine trios representing increasing levels of heterozygosity were generated that each demonstrate a substantial improvement in contiguity and accuracy over the current Bos taurus reference genome, with more telomere and centromere content and an average 2.5x increase in NG50 and 11x decrease in base errors. Downsampling analysis demonstrated that diploid coverage as low as 20x for HiFi or 60x for ONT was sufficient to produce two haplotype-resolved assemblies meeting the standards set by the Vertebrate Genome Project. The assemblies were integrated into structural variant-based pangenomes that demonstrated significant consensus regardless of sequence platform, assembler algorithm, or coverage. Inspecting pangenome topologies identified approximately 900 structural variants overlapping with coding sequences; this approach revealed variants affecting QRICH2, PRDM9, HSPA1A, TAS2R46 and GC that have potential to affect phenotype.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here, we present GfaViz, an interactive graphical tool for the visualization of sequence graphs in GFA format. The software supports all new features of GFA 2 and introduces conventions for their visualization. The user can choose between two different layouts and multiple styles for representing single elements or groups. All customizations can be stored in custom tags of the GFA format itself, without requiring external configuration files. Stylesheets are supported for storing standard configuration options for groups of files. The visualizations can be exported to raster and vector graphics formats.

  abstract={We have previously shown that exon 1 of the huntingtin gene does not always splice to exon 2 resulting in the production of a small polyadenylated mRNA (HTTexon1) that encodes the highly pathogenic exon 1 HTT protein. The level of this read-through product is proportional to CAG repeat length and is present in all knock-in mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD) with CAG lengths of 50 and above and in the YAC128 and BACHD mouse models, both of which express a copy of the human HTT gene. We have now developed specific protocols for the quantitative analysis of the transcript levels of HTTexon1 in human tissue and applied these to a series of fibroblast lines and post-mortem brain samples from individuals with either adult-onset or juvenile-onset HD. We found that the HTTexon1 mRNA is present in fibroblasts from juvenile HD patients and can also be readily detected in the sensory motor cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of post-mortem brains from HD individuals, particularly in those with early onset disease. This finding will have important implications for strategies to lower mutant HTT levels in patients and the design of future therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating, late-onset, inherited neurodegenerative disorder that manifests with personality changes, movement disorders, and cognitive decline. It is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the HTT gene that translates to a polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein (HTT). The formation of HTT fragments has been implicated as an essential step in the molecular pathogenesis of HD and several proteases that cleave HTT have been identified. However, the importance of smaller N-terminal fragments has been highlighted by their presence in HD postmortem brains and by the fact that nuclear inclusions are only detected by antibodies to the N terminus of HTT. Despite an intense research effort, the precise length of these fragments and the mechanism by which they are generated remains unknown. Here we show that CAG repeat length{\textendash}dependent aberrant splicing of exon 1 HTT results in a short polyadenylated mRNA that is translated into an exon 1 HTT protein. Given that mutant exon 1 HTT proteins have consistently been shown to be highly pathogenic in HD mouse models, the aberrant splicing of HTT mRNA provides a mechanistic basis for the molecular pathogenesis of HD. RNA-targeted therapeutic strategies designed to lower the levels of HTT are under development. Many of these approaches would not prevent the production of exon 1 HTT and should be reviewed in light of our findings.},

  abstract = "{Motivation: Over the last few years, methods based on suffix arrays using the Burrows–Wheeler Transform have been widely used for DNA sequence read matching and assembly. These provide very fast search algorithms, linear in the search pattern size, on a highly compressible representation of the dataset being searched. Meanwhile, algorithmic development for genotype data has concentrated on statistical methods for phasing and imputation, based on probabilistic matching to hidden Markov model representations of the reference data, which while powerful are much less computationally efficient. Here a theory of haplotype matching using suffix array ideas is developed, which should scale too much larger datasets than those currently handled by genotype algorithms.Results: Given M sequences with N bi-allelic variable sites, an O(NM) algorithm to derive a representation of the data based on positional prefix arrays is given, which is termed the positional Burrows–Wheeler transform (PBWT). On large datasets this compresses with run-length encoding by more than a factor of a hundred smaller than using gzip on the raw data. Using this representation a method is given to find all maximal haplotype matches within the set in O(NM) time rather than O(NM2) as expected from naive pairwise comparison, and also a fast algorithm, empirically independent of M given sufficient memory for indexes, to find maximal matches between a new sequence and the set. The discussion includes some proposals about how these approaches could be used for imputation and phasing.Availability:http://github.com/richarddurbin/pbwtContact:richard.durbin@sanger.ac.uk}",

However, implementing and correctly using this data model can be difficult, and the scale of pangenomic datasets can be challenging to work at. These challenges have impeded progress in this field.Here, we present a stack of two C++ libraries, libbdsg and libhandlegraph, which use a simple, field-proven interface, designed to expose elementary features of these graphs while preventing common graph manipulation mistakes. The libraries also provide a Python binding. Using a diverse collection of pangenome graphs, we demonstrate that these tools allow for efficient construction and manipulation of large genome graphs with dense variation. For instance, the speed and memory usage are up to an order of magnitude better than the prior graph implementation in the VG toolkit, which has now transitioned to using libbdsg’s implementations.libhandlegraph and libbdsg are available under an MIT License from https://github.com/vgteam/libhandlegraph and https://github.com/vgteam/libbdsg.}",

Here we describe an integrated set of eight structural variant classes comprising both balanced and unbalanced variants, which we constructed using short-read DNA sequencing data and statistically phased onto haplotype blocks in 26 human populations. Analysing this set, we identify numerous gene-intersecting structural variants exhibiting population stratification and describe naturally occurring homozygous gene knockouts that suggest the dispensability of a variety of human genes. We demonstrate that structural variants are enriched on haplotypes identified by genome-wide association studies and exhibit enrichment for expression quantitative trait loci. Additionally, we uncover appreciable levels of structural variant complexity at different scales, including genic loci subject to clusters of repeated rearrangement and complex structural variants with multiple breakpoints likely to have formed through individual mutational events. Our catalogue will enhance future studies into structural variant demography, functional impact and disease association.},

  abstract     = {MOTIVATION: Pairwise alignment of sequences is a fundamental method in modern molecular biology, implemented within multiple bioinformatics tools and libraries. Current advances in sequencing technologies press for the development of faster pairwise alignment algorithms that can scale with increasing read lengths and production yields. RESULTS: In this paper, we present the wavefront alignment algorithm (WFA), an exact gap-affine algorithm that takes advantage of homologous regions between the sequences to accelerate the alignment process. As opposed to traditional dynamic programming algorithms that run in quadratic time, the WFA runs in time O(ns), proportional to the read length n and the alignment score s, using O(s2) memory. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits simple data dependencies that can be easily vectorized, even by the automatic features of modern compilers, for different architectures, without the need to adapt the code. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm, together with other state-of-the-art implementations. As a result, we demonstrate that the WFA runs 20-300x faster than other methods aligning short Illumina-like sequences, and 10-100x faster using long noisy reads like those produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. AVAILABILITY: The WFA algorithm is implemented within the wavefront-aligner library, and it is publicly available at https://github.com/smarco/WFA.},

For example, the number of vertebrate genome assemblies currently in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database(4) increased by more than 50\% to 1,485 assemblies in the year from July 2018 to July 2019. In addition to this influx of assemblies from different species, new human de novo assemblies(5) are being produced, which enable the analysis of not only small polymorphisms, but also complex, large-scale structural differences between human individuals and haplotypes. This coming era and its unprecedented amount of data offer the opportunity to uncover many insights into genome evolution but also present challenges in how to adapt current analysis methods to meet the increased scale. Cactus(6), a reference-free multiple genome alignment program, has been shown to be highly accurate, but the existing implementation scales poorly with increasing numbers of genomes, and struggles in regions of highly duplicated sequences. Here we describe progressive extensions to Cactus to create Progressive Cactus, which enables the reference-free alignment of tens to thousands of large vertebrate genomes while maintaining high alignment quality. We describe results from an alignment of more than 600 amniote genomes, which is to our knowledge the largest multiple vertebrate genome alignment created so far.},

By developing methods to integrate information across several algorithms and diverse data sources, we provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short insertions and deletions, and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting changes in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource, which captures up to 98\% of accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms at a frequency of 1\% in related populations, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.},

  abstract     = {MOTIVATION: Protocols to generate strand-specific transcriptomes with next-generation sequencing platforms have been used by the scientific community roughly since 2008. Strand-specific reads allow for detection of antisense events and a higher resolution of expression profiles enabling extension of current transcript annotations. However, applications making use of this strandedness information are still scarce. RESULTS: Here we present a tool (Janus), which focuses on the identification of transcriptional active regions in antisense orientation to known and novel transcribed elements of the genome. Janus can compare the antisense events of multiple samples and assigns scores to identify mutual expression of either transcript in a sense/antisense pair, which could hint to regulatory mechanisms. Janus is able to make use of single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and methylation data, if available, and reports the sense to antisense ratio of regions in the vicinity of the identified genetic and epigenetic variation. Janus interrogates positions of heterozygous SNVs to identify strand-specific allelic imbalance.

We used patterns of polymorphisms in functionally annotated regions in 1092 humans to identify deleterious variants; then we experimentally validated candidates. We analyzed both coding and noncoding regions, with the former corroborating the latter. We found regions particularly sensitive to mutations ("ultrasensitive") and variants that are disruptive because of mechanistic effects on transcription-factor binding (that is, "motif-breakers"). We also found variants in regions with higher network centrality tend to be deleterious. Insertions and deletions followed a similar pattern to single-nucleotide variants, with some notable exceptions (e.g., certain deletions and enhancers). On the basis of these patterns, we developed a computational tool (FunSeq), whose application to ~90 cancer genomes reveals nearly a hundred candidate noncoding drivers.},

There are a number of techniques to represent and organize data gleaned from these cohorts, many using ideas implicitly or explicitly borrowed from graph-based models.

Historically, the ancestry of modern Ugandans was best represented by a mixture of ancient East African pastoralists. We demonstrate the value of the largest sequence panel from Africa to date as an imputation resource. Examining 34 cardiometabolic traits, we show systematic differences in trait heritability between European and African populations, probably reflecting the differential impact of genes and environment. In a multi-trait pan-African GWAS of up to 14,126 individuals, we identify novel loci associated with anthropometric, hematological, lipid, and glycemic traits. We find that several functionally important signals are driven by Africa-specific variants, highlighting the value of studying diverse populations across the region.},

However, conventional linear references represent only one version of each locus, ignoring variation in the population. Poor representation of an individual's genome sequence impacts read mapping and introduces bias. Variation graphs are bidirected DNA sequence graphs that compactly represent genetic variation across a population, including large-scale structural variation such as inversions and duplications. Previous graph genome software implementations have been limited by scalability or topological constraints. Here we present vg, a toolkit of computational methods for creating, manipulating, and using these structures as references at the scale of the human genome. vg provides an efficient approach to mapping reads onto arbitrary variation graphs using generalized compressed suffix arrays, with improved accuracy over alignment to a linear reference, and effectively removing reference bias. These capabilities make using variation graphs as references for DNA sequencing practical at a gigabase scale, or at the topological complexity of de novo assemblies.},

In genome assembly and genetics, the possible paths through a superbubble can be considered to represent the set of possible sequences at a location in a genome. Bidirected and biedged graphs are a generalization of digraphs that are increasingly being used to more fully represent genome assembly and variation problems. In this study, we define snarls and ultrabubbles, generalizations of superbubbles for bidirected and biedged graphs, and give an efficient algorithm for the detection of these more general structures. Key to this algorithm is the cactus graph, which, we show, encodes the nested decomposition of a graph into snarls and ultrabubbles within its structure. We propose and demonstrate empirically that this decomposition on bidirected and biedged graphs solves a fundamental problem by defining genetic sites for any collection of genomic variations, including complex structural variations, without need for any single reference genome coordinate system. Further, the nesting of the decomposition gives a natural way to describe and model variations contained within large variations, a case not currently dealt with by existing formats [e.g., variant cell format (VCF)].},

Here, we assembled a Japanese genome using single-molecule real-time sequencing data and characterized insertions found in the assembled genome. We identified 3691 insertions ranging from 100 bps to ~10,000 bps in the assembled genome relative to the international reference sequence (GRCh38). To validate and characterize these insertions, we mapped short-reads from 1070 Japanese individuals and 728 individuals from eight other populations to insertions integrated into GRCh38. With this result, we constructed JRGv1 (Japanese Reference Genome version 1) by integrating the 903 verified insertions, totaling 1,086,173 bases, shared by at least two Japanese individuals into GRCh38. We also constructed decoyJRGv1 by concatenating 3559 verified insertions, totaling 2,536,870 bases, shared by at least two Japanese individuals or by six other assemblies. This assembly improved the alignment ratio by 0.4\% on average. These results demonstrate the importance of refining the reference assembly and creating a population-specific reference genome.

Here we performed whole-genome sequencing analyses of 426 individuals-comprising 50 ethnolinguistic groups, including previously unsampled populations-to explore the breadth of genomic diversity across Africa. We uncovered more than 3 million previously undescribed variants, most of which were found among individuals from newly sampled ethnolinguistic groups, as well as 62 previously unreported loci that are under strong selection, which were predominantly found in genes that are involved in viral immunity, DNA repair and metabolism. We observed complex patterns of ancestral admixture and putative-damaging and novel variation, both within and between populations, alongside evidence that Zambia was a likely intermediate site along the routes of expansion of Bantu-speaking populations. Pathogenic variants in genes that are currently characterized as medically relevant were uncommon-but in other genes, variants denoted as 'likely pathogenic' in the ClinVar database were commonly observed. Collectively, these findings refine our current understanding of continental migration, identify gene flow and the response to human disease as strong drivers of genome-level population variation, and underscore the scientific imperative for a broader characterization of the genomic diversity of African individuals to understand human ancestry and improve health.},

  abstract     = {We used a deeply sequenced dataset of 910 individuals, all of African descent, to construct a set of DNA sequences that is present in these individuals but missing from the reference human genome. We aligned 1.19 trillion reads from the 910 individuals to the reference genome (GRCh38), collected all reads that failed to align, and assembled these reads into contiguous sequences (contigs). We then compared all contigs to one another to identify a set of unique sequences representing regions of the African pan-genome missing from the reference genome. Our analysis revealed 296,485,284 bp in 125,715 distinct contigs present in the populations of African descent, demonstrating that the African pan-genome contains ~10\% more DNA than the current human reference genome. Although the functional significance of nearly all of this sequence is unknown, 387 of the novel contigs fall within 315 distinct protein-coding genes, and the rest appear to be intergenic.},

Although each path in the graph is a potential haplotype, most paths are non-biological, unlikely recombinations of true haplotypes. RESULTS: We augment the VG model with haplotype information to identify which paths are more likely to exist in nature. For this purpose, we develop a scalable implementation of the graph extension of the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform. We demonstrate the scalability of the new implementation by building a whole-genome index of the 5008 haplotypes of the 1000 Genomes Project, and an index of all 108 070 Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine Freeze 5 chromosome 17 haplotypes. We also develop an algorithm for simplifying variation graphs for k-mer indexing without losing any k-mers in the haplotypes.

The approach can perform a genome-wide association analysis on a dataset of one million SNPs across one million individuals at a cost of about 868 CPU days with an elapsed time on the order of two weeks. A Python implementation is available at https://fastlmm.github.io/.Significance Identifying SNP-phenotype correlations using GWAS is difficult because effect sizes are so small for common, complex diseases. To address this issue, institutions are creating extremely large cohorts with sample sizes on the order of one million. Unfortunately, such cohorts are likely to contain confounding factors such as population structure and family/cryptic relatedness. The linear mixed model (LMM) can often correct for such confounding factors, but is too slow to use even with algebraic speedups known as FaST-LMM. We present a cloud implementation of FaST-LMM, called Ludicrous Speed LMM, that can process one million samples and one million test SNPs in a reasonable amount of time and at a reasonable cost.},

  abstract     = {A substantial portion of the primate genome is composed of non-coding regions, so-called "dark matter", which includes an abundance of tandemly repeated sequences called satellite DNA. Collectively known as the satellitome, this genomic component offers exciting evolutionary insights into aspects of primate genome biology that raise new questions and challenge existing paradigms. A complete human reference genome was recently reported with telomere-to-telomere human X chromosome assembly that resolved hundreds of dark regions, encompassing a 3.1 Mb centromeric satellite array that had not been identified previously. With the recent exponential increase in the availability of primate genomes, and the development of modern genomic and bioinformatics tools, extensive growth in our knowledge concerning the structure, function, and evolution of satellite elements is expected. The current state of knowledge on this topic is summarized, highlighting various types of primate-specific satellite repeats to compare their proportions across diverse lineages. Inter- and intraspecific variation of satellite repeats in the primate genome are reviewed. The functional significance of these sequences is discussed by describing how the transcriptional activity of satellite repeats can affect gene expression during different cellular processes. Sex-linked satellites are outlined, together with their respective genomic organization. Mechanisms are proposed whereby satellite repeats might have emerged as novel sequences during different evolutionary phases. Finally, the main challenges that hinder the detection of satellite DNA are outlined and an overview of the latest methodologies to address technological limitations is presented.},

However, no single chromosome has been finished end to end, and hundreds of unresolved gaps persist(1,2). Here we present a human genome assembly that surpasses the continuity of GRCh38(2), along with a gapless, telomere-to-telomere assembly of a human chromosome. This was enabled by high-coverage, ultra-long-read nanopore sequencing of the complete hydatidiform mole CHM13 genome, combined with complementary technologies for quality improvement and validation. Focusing our efforts on the human X chromosome(3), we reconstructed the centromeric satellite DNA array (approximately 3.1 Mb) and closed the 29 remaining gaps in the current reference, including new sequences from the human pseudoautosomal regions and from cancer-testis ampliconic gene families (CT-X and GAGE). These sequences will be integrated into future human reference genome releases. In addition, the complete chromosome X, combined with the ultra-long nanopore data, allowed us to map methylation patterns across complex tandem repeats and satellite arrays. Our results demonstrate that finishing the entire human genome is now within reach, and the data presented here will facilitate ongoing efforts to complete the other human chromosomes.},

  abstract     = {Sharing human genotype and phenotype data is essential to discover otherwise inaccessible genetic associations, but is a challenge because of privacy concerns. Here, we present a method of homomorphic encryption that obscures individuals' genotypes and phenotypes, and is suited to quantitative genetic association analysis. Encrypted ciphertext and unencrypted plaintext are analytically interchangeable. The encryption uses a high-dimensional random linear orthogonal transformation key that leaves the likelihood of quantitative trait data unchanged under a linear model with normally distributed errors. It also preserves linkage disequilibrium between genetic variants and associations between variants and phenotypes. It scrambles relationships between individuals: encrypted genotype dosages closely resemble Gaussian deviates, and can be replaced by quantiles from a Gaussian with negligible effects on accuracy. Likelihood-based inferences are unaffected by orthogonal encryption. These include linear mixed models to control for unequal relatedness between individuals, heritability estimation, and including covariates when testing association. Orthogonal transformations can be applied in a modular fashion for multiparty federated mega-analyses where the parties first agree to share a common set of genotype sites and covariates prior to encryption. Each then privately encrypts and shares their own ciphertext, and analyses all parties' ciphertexts. In the absence of private variants, or knowledge of the key, we show that it is infeasible to decrypt ciphertext using existing brute-force or noise-reduction attacks. We present the method as a challenge to the community to determine its security.},

  abstract     = {Genotype imputation estimates the genotypes of unobserved variants using the genotype data of other observed variants based on a collection of haplotypes for thousands of individuals, which is known as a haplotype reference panel. In general, more accurate imputation results were obtained using a larger size of haplotype reference panel. Most of the existing genotype imputation methods explicitly require the haplotype reference panel in precise form, but the accessibility of haplotype data is often limited, due to the requirement of agreements from the donors. Since de-identified information such as summary statistics or model parameters can be used publicly, imputation methods using de-identified haplotype reference information might be useful to enhance the quality of imputation results under the condition where the access of the haplotype data is limited. In this study, we proposed a novel imputation method that handles the reference panel as its model parameters by using bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN). The model parameters are presented in the form of de-identified information from which the restoration of the genotype data at the individual-level is almost impossible. We demonstrated that the proposed method provides comparable imputation accuracy when compared with the existing imputation methods using haplotype datasets from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) and the Haplotype Reference Consortium. We also considered a scenario where a subset of haplotypes is made available only in de-identified form for the haplotype reference panel. In the evaluation using the 1KGP dataset under the scenario, the imputation accuracy of the proposed method is much higher than that of the existing imputation methods. We therefore conclude that our RNN-based method is quite promising to further promote the data-sharing of sensitive genome data under the recent movement for the protection of individuals' privacy.},

  abstract     = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS--the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases--make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

 the {FAIR} Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and

This mantra, chanted by scientists for more than a century, has led to a virtual prohibition on causal talk. Today, that taboo is dead. The causal revolution, instigated by Judea Pearl and his colleagues, has cut through a century of confusion and established causality--the study of cause and effect--on a firm scientific basis. His work explains how we can know easy things, like whether it was rain or a sprinkler that made a sidewalk wet; and how to answer hard questions, like whether a drug cured an illness. Pearl's work enables us to know not just whether one thing causes another: it lets us explore the world that is and the worlds that could have been. It shows us the essence of human thought and key to artificial intelligence. Anyone who wants to understand either needs The Book of Why.}

Key features of the dictionary are its compact size, its network independence, and the ability to convert the entire dictionary to a wide variety of common application programs. Another significant feature is the integration of DNA sequence accession data. Loci in the dictionary can be rapidly resorted by chromosomal position, by type, by human homology, or by gene effect. The dictionary provides an accessible, easily manipulated set of data that has many uses--from a quick review of loci and gene nomenclature to the design of experiments and analysis of results. The Portable Dictionary is available in several formats suitable for conversion to different programs and computer systems. It can be obtained on disk or from Internet Gopher servers (mickey.utmen.edu or anat4.utmen.edu), an anonymous FTP site (nb.utmem.edu in the directory pub/genedict), and a World Wide Web server (http://mickey.utmem.edu/front.html).},

  abstract = {The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning
high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise
syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we present several extensions
that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling
of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word
representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax
called negative sampling.An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference
to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the
meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated
by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show
that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

	Structural variations (SVs) and gene copy number variations (gCNVs) have contributed to crop evolution, domestication, and improvement. Here, we assembled 31 high-quality genomes of genetically diverse rice accessions. Coupling with two existing assemblies, we developed pan-genome-scale genomic resources including a graph-based genome, providing access to rice genomic variations. Specifically, we discovered 171,072 SVs and 25,549 gCNVs and used an Oryza glaberrima assembly to infer the derived states of SVs in the Oryza sativa population. Our analyses of SV formation mechanisms, impacts on gene expression, and distributions among subpopulations illustrate the utility of these resources for understanding how SVs and gCNVs shaped rice environmental adaptation and domestication. Our graph-based genome enabled genome-wide association study (GWAS)-based identification of phenotype-associated genetic variations undetectable when using only SNPs and a single reference assembly. Our work provides rich population-scale resources paired with easy-to-access tools to facilitate rice breeding as well as plant functional genomics and evolutionary biology research.}

  abstract = {Summary
	Soybean is one of the most important vegetable oil and protein feed crops. To capture the entire genomic diversity, it is needed to construct a complete high-quality pan-genome from diverse soybean accessions. In this study, we performed individual de novo genome assemblies for 26 representative soybeans that were selected from 2,898 deeply sequenced accessions. Using these assembled genomes together with three previously reported genomes, we constructed a graph-based genome and performed pan-genome analysis, which identified numerous genetic variations that cannot be detected by direct mapping of short sequence reads onto a single reference genome. The structural variations from the 2,898 accessions that were genotyped based on the graph-based genome and the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from the representative 26 accessions helped to link genetic variations to candidate genes that are responsible for important traits. This pan-genome resource will promote evolutionary and functional genomics studies in soybean.}

  abstract={Structural variants (SVs) represent a major source of genetic diversity and are related to numerous agronomic traits and evolutionary events; however, their comprehensive identification and characterization in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) have been hindered by the lack of a high-quality pan-genome. Here, we report a graph-based cucumber pan-genome by analyzing twelve chromosome-scale genome assemblies. Genotyping of seven large chromosomal rearrangements based on the pan-genome provides useful information for use of wild accessions in breeding and genetic studies. A total of {\textasciitilde}4.3 million genetic variants including 56,214 SVs are identified leveraging the chromosome-level assemblies. The pan-genome graph integrating both variant information and reference genome sequences aids the identification of SVs associated with agronomic traits, including warty fruits, flowering times and root growth, and enhances the understanding of cucumber trait evolution. The graph-based cucumber pan-genome and the identified genetic variants provide rich resources for future biological research and genomics-assisted breeding.},

  abstract = "{Horizontal transfer, gene loss, and duplication result in dynamic bacterial genomes shaped by a complex mixture of different modes of evolution. Closely related strains can differ in the presence or absence of many genes, and the total number of distinct genes found in a set of related isolates—the pan-genome—is often many times larger than the genome of individual isolates. We have developed a pipeline that efficiently identifies orthologous gene clusters in the pan-genome. This pipeline is coupled to a powerful yet easy-to-use web-based visualization for interactive exploration of the pan-genome. The visualization consists of connected components that allow rapid filtering and searching of genes and inspection of their evolutionary history. For each gene cluster, panX displays an alignment, a phylogenetic tree, maps mutations within that cluster to the branches of the tree and infers gain and loss of genes on the core-genome phylogeny. PanX is available at pangenome.de. Custom pan-genomes can be visualized either using a web server or by serving panX locally as a browser-based application.}",

  abstract = {The use of comparative genomics for functional, evolutionary, and epidemiological studies requires methods to classify gene families in terms of occurrence in a given species. These methods usually lack multivariate statistical models to infer the partitions and the optimal number of classes and don’t account for genome organization. We introduce a graph structure to model pangenomes in which nodes represent gene families and edges represent genomic neighborhood. Our method, named PPanGGOLiN, partitions nodes using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm based on multivariate Bernoulli Mixture Model coupled with a Markov Random Field. This approach takes into account the topology of the graph and the presence/absence of genes in pangenomes to classify gene families into persistent, cloud, and one or several shell partitions. By analyzing the partitioned pangenome graphs of isolate genomes from 439 species and metagenome-assembled genomes from 78 species, we demonstrate that our method is effective in estimating the persistent genome. Interestingly, it shows that the shell genome is a key element to understand genome dynamics, presumably because it reflects how genes present at intermediate frequencies drive adaptation of species, and its proportion in genomes is independent of genome size. The graph-based approach proposed by PPanGGOLiN is useful to depict the overall genomic diversity of thousands of strains in a compact structure and provides an effective basis for very large scale comparative genomics.

  abstract={Despite only 8{\%} of cattle being found in Europe, European breeds dominate current genetic resources. This adversely impacts cattle research in other important global cattle breeds, especially those from Africa for which genomic resources are particularly limited, despite their disproportionate importance to the continent's economies. To mitigate this issue, we have generated assemblies of African breeds, which have been integrated with genomic data for 294 diverse cattle into a graph genome that incorporates global cattle diversity. We illustrate how this more representative reference assembly contains an extra 116.1{\thinspace}Mb (4.2{\%}) of sequence absent from the current Hereford sequence and consequently inaccessible to current studies. We further demonstrate how using this graph genome increases read mapping rates, reduces allelic biases and improves the agreement of structural variant calling with independent optical mapping data. Consequently, we present an improved, more representative, reference assembly that will improve global cattle research.},

  abstract = {Bread wheat is one of humanity{\textquoteright}s most important staple crops, characterized by a large and complex genome with a high level of gene presence/absence variation between cultivars, hampering genomic approaches for crop improvement. With the growing global population and the increasing impact of climate change on crop yield, there is an urgent need to apply genomic approaches to accelerate wheat breeding. With recent advances in DNA sequencing technology, a growing number of high-quality reference genomes are becoming available, reflecting the genetic content of a diverse range of cultivars. However, information on the presence or absence of genomic regions has been hard to visualize and interrogate due to the size of these genomes and the lack of suitable bioinformatics tools. To address this limitation, we have produced a wheat pangenome graph maintained within an online database to facilitate interrogation and comparison of wheat cultivar genomes. The database allows users to visualize regions of the pangenome to assess presence/absence variation between bread wheat genomes.Database URL: http://www.appliedbioinformatics.com.au/wheat_panacheCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {The genomic diversity of microbes is commonly parameterized as population genetic polymorphisms relative to a reference genome of a well-characterized, but arbitrary, isolate. Reference genomes contain a fraction of the microbial pangenome, the set of genes observed within all isolates of a given species, and are thus blind to both the dynamics of the accessory genome, as well as variation within gene order and copy number. With the wide-spread usage of long-read sequencing, the number of high-quality, complete genome assemblies has increased dramatically. Traditional computational approaches towards whole-genome analysis either scale poorly, or treat genomes as dissociated bags of genes, and thus are not suited for this new era. Here, we present PanGraph, a Julia based library and command line interface for aligning whole genomes into a graph, wherein each genome is represented as an undirected path along vertices, which in turn, encapsulate homologous multiple sequence alignments. The resultant data structure succinctly summarizes population-level nucleotide and structural polymorphisms and can be exported into a several common formats for either downstream analysis or immediate visualization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

With few exceptions, graph drawing algorithms typically optimize one such criterion, usually at the expense of others. We propose a layout approach, Multicriteria Scalable Graph Drawing via Stochastic Gradient Descent, \$(SGD){\textasciicircum}2\$, that can handle multiple readability criteria. \$(SGD){\textasciicircum}2\$ can optimize any criterion that can be described by a differentiable function. Our approach is flexible and can be used to optimize several criteria that have already been considered earlier (e.g., obtaining ideal edge lengths, stress, neighborhood preservation) as well as other criteria which have not yet been explicitly optimized in such fashion (e.g., node resolution, angular resolution, aspect ratio). The approach is scalable and can handle large graphs. A variation of the underlying approach can also be used to optimize many desirable properties in planar graphs, while maintaining planarity. Finally, we provide quantitative and qualitative evidence of the effectiveness of \$(SGD){\textasciicircum}2\$: we analyze the interactions between criteria, measure the quality of layouts generated from \$(SGD){\textasciicircum}2\$ as well as the runtime behavior, and analyze the impact of sample sizes.

Our toolchain, which consists of additions to the VG toolkit and a standalone tool, RPVG, can construct spliced pangenome graphs, map RNA sequencing data to these graphs, and perform haplotype-aware expression quantification of transcripts in a pantranscriptome.

	abstract = {Motivation Compared to eukaryotes, prokaryote genomes are more diverse through different mechanisms, including a higher mutation rate and horizontal gene transfer. Therefore, using a linear representative reference can cause a reference bias. Graph-based pangenome methods have been developed to tackle this problem. However, comparisons in DNA space is still challenging due to this high diversity. In contrast, amino acids have higher similarity due to evolutionary constraints, resulting in conserved amino acids that, however, may be encoded by several synonymous codons. Coding regions cover the majority of the genome in prokaryotes. Thus, building panproteomes leverages the high sequence similarity while not losing much of the genome in non-coding regions.
Results We present PanPA, a method that takes a set of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of proteins or protein clusters, indexes them, and builds a graph for each MSA. In the querying step, it can align DNA or amino acid sequences back to these graphs. We first showcase that PanPA generates correct alignments on a panproteome from 1,350 E. coli. To demonstrate that panproteomes allow longer phylogenetic distance comparison, we compare DNA and protein alignments from 1,073 S. enterica assemblies against E. coli reference genome, pangenome, and panproteome using BWA, GraphAligner, and PanPA respectively, where PanPA was able to produce around 22\% more alignments. We also aligned DNA short-reads WGS sample from S. enterica against the E. coli reference with BWA and the panproteome with PanPA, where PanPA was able to find alignment for 69\% of the reads compared to 5\% with BWA
